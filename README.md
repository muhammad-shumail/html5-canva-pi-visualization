# PI Visualizer

PI Visualizer is an interactive visualization of the mathematical constant PI, built using HTML5 Canvas and JavaScript. It provides a unique and engaging way to understand and explore this important mathematical concept.

## Features

- **Interactive Visualization**: Watch PI come to life through a dynamic and colorful display.
- **Gradient Colors**: The visualizer uses a gradient color scheme that changes as the visualization progresses, making the experience even more engaging.
- **Built with HTML5 Canvas and JavaScript**: Leverages the power of HTML5 Canvas for graphics and JavaScript for the logic.

## How It Works

The PI Visualizer draws a circle and a moving line that starts from the center of the circle and ends at the circumference. The line moves around the circle, creating a visualization of PI. The color of the line changes for each frame, creating a gradient effect.
